# Twelve Labs Python SDK

This SDK provides a convenient way to interact with the Twelve Labs Video Understanding Platform from an application written in the Python language. The SDK equips you with a set of intuitive classes and methods that streamline the process of interacting with the platform, reducing the boilerplate code you have to write.
